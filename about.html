			<h2>Myself</h2>
			<p>Among other things I enjoy learning and reading new books. I also play ice
				hockey and am a huge Pittsburgh Penguins fan. I enjoy playing video games
				with friends and being competitive. Reading about new technology, computers
				and mobile devices is something I like to keep myself up to date on. At
				the center of it all I really enjoy spending time with my family. I am
				currently engaged to my beautiful bride-to-be Megan, who is a Registered
				Nurse for Concordia Lutheran Services.</p>

			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>I am currently a full time student at
				<a href="http://www.bc3.edu" title="BC3" target="new">Butler County Community College</a>,
				in Western Pennsylvania, where I am studying to become a Network Administrator.
				Some of my specific classes include Data Communications and Networking,
				Database Systems, Computer and Internet Security, Windows Server Administrator
				and a handful of other exciting courses. I am currently scheduled to graduate
				in the spring of 2015. I am also currently studying to become certified in
				the CompTIA program of A+, Network+ and Security+.</p>

			<h2>Technology</h2>
			<p>Growing up I knew I loved technology. I just did not know how to direct my
				life professionally towards it. As a young child I was always using my parents
				Tandy desktop computer playing games and using the Encarta Encyclopedia to
				learn new information. From there it only grew into wanting to learn and
				understand more about the technology field. I was building, repairing and
				troubleshooting PCs consistently for family and friends. I also started
				repairing and troubleshooting mobile devices. I would fix and repair cracked
				screens and replace other faulty components for friends. The list goes on.</p>

			<h2>Medical Simulation</h2>
			<p>I had no idea that four years of my life would be spent interacting with
				sophisticated medical technology. I was a Lead Installation Technician
				at Kb Port and learned a lot about not only computers but technology and
				how it applies to the medical field. I have an extensive knowledge base
				and troubleshooting skill with popular healthcare manikins;
				specifically, <a href="http://www.laerdal.com/us/nav/207/Patient-Simulators"
					title="Laerdal Medical Simulators" target="new">Laerdal</a>, 
				<a href="http://www.gaumard.com/noelle/" title="Gaumard Medical Simulators"
					target="new">Gaumard</a> and 
				<a href="http://www.caehealthcare.com/eng/patient-simulators/metiman"
					title="Metiman Medical Simulators" target="new">Metiman</a> simulators.
				I also developed other various skills including audio and video installation
				and troubleshooting. It also taught me to be well prepared. Our jobs were
				sometimes up to 2,600 miles away from our shop. We had to be prepared and
				packed with our tools, equipment, and other supplies.</p>

			<h2>Graphic/Web Design</h2>
			<p>I had the privilege of working with a few wonderful web programmers. At Kb Port,
				I also was responsible for graphic design and product photography.
				I had hand in helping design
				<a href="http://www.kbport.com/" title="Kb Port" target="new">Kb Port’s website</a>.
				I handled a large amount of the graphics and product photography included in
				the website. It was then I learned a lot of great skills in using Adobe’s
				Photoshop software. I also learned a large amount of HTML and CSS.</p>

			<h2>Writing</h2>
			<p>When you work at a small company you get your hands dirty in a lot of projects.
				I also had the privilege of writing user manuals using Adobe’s InDesign
				software. This desktop publishing software allowed me to write manuals for
				each one of the products. It also was helpful in creating tutorials where I
				would use screenshots and graphics to help users get the most out of their
				systems right out of the box. Technical writing was another area I had to
				be proficient in while creating/updating the user manuals. I was able to
				communicate instructions in a clear and concise manner to our customers/clients.
				I write hockey and technology columns for The Cube, which is BC3's
				student newspaper.</p>
